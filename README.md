# TDA7292-Amplifier
	It is an HiFi stereo amplifier board based on TDA7292 IC. It will give top quality audio without any compromises. It can provide up-to 40W+40W power output.

## Specifications
	* Based on TDA7292
	* 100x100mm PCB
	* Mute & Standby Support
	* High Quality Capacitors

## Challenge:
	I saw the cost of pre made HiFi Audio Amplifiers is too high and low cost amplifiers don't perform well. so I wanted to create a HiFi Stereo Amplifier without compromising anything, so I can use it for my home.
	
## Solution:
	So, I designed a HiFi Stereo Amplifier based of TDA7292 IC, which can provide up-to 40W+40W power output. It is a 10cm*10cm PCB. Mostly I used Metal Film, Mica and Ceramic Capacitors, So It can deliver High Quality sound. I have also Isolated High Power Components with Low Power Components to reduce Noise. It also has a Mute and Standby circuits for effectively reduce power when not in use.
